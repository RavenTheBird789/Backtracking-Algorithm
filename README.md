Simple python backtracking algorithm made using the random module

This was made to show an example of a backtracking algorithm commonly prompted by interviewers for software engineering and programming jobs along with a simple shuffling permutation that randomly selects an item from a list to add to another list while removing the migrated item from the original list in the process until the original list is empty

Prerequisites: Ensure that you have the latest version of python installed in your terminal

To install, simply type "git clone https://github.com/RavenTheBird789/Backtracking-Algorithm/tree/main" in your command line

To run, simply type "python3 backtrac.py" or "python3 shuff_per.py" in your command line
